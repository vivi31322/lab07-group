## Test bclr rd, rs1, rs2
## returns rs1 with a single bit cleared at the index specified in rs2. 
## The index is read from the lower log2(XLEN) = 5 bits of rs2

main:

addi x28, x0, -5
bclri x30, x28, 7
## -5 = 0xffff_fffb
## clearing the 7th bit makes 0xfb = 8'b1111_1011 becomes 8'b0111_1011 = 0x7b
## so x30 should be 0xffff_ff7b
