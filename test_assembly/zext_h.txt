## Test zext.h rd, rs
## zero-extends the least-significant halfword of the source to XLEN 
## by inserting 0â€™s into all of the bits more significant than 15

main:

addi   x29, x0, -23
zext.h x30, x29
## -23 = 0xffff_ffe9, least-significant halfword (16bits) = 0xffe9
## so x30 should be 0x0000_ffe9
