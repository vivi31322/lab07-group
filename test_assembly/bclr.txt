## Test bclr rd, rs1, rs2
## returns rs1 with a single bit cleared at the index specified in rs2. 
## The index is read from the lower log2(XLEN) = 5 bits of rs2

main:

addi x28, x0, -5
addi x29, x0, -7
bclr x30, x28, x29
## -5 = 0xffff_fffb, -7 = 0xffff_fff9 -> take lower 5 bits -> 0x19 = 25
## clearing the 25th bit makes x30 become 0xfdff_fffb
